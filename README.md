## How do I approach designing software?

By doing this 3D project, I have been able to learn a lot about designing and creating 3D scenes. As part of this project I created a 3D environment in OpenGL modeled after a real world image. This process of building a 3D scene based on a real image can help me in my future work if I need to create 3D models or scenes.

## How do I approach developing programs?

In this project, I got a chance to use C++ and OpenGL. C++ is a really great language to be comfortable with, and this project gave ma a chance to work more with some of the features in the language I am not as comfortable with such as pointers. Additionally, learning OpenGL has broaded my understanding of how 3D scenes are created.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Being able to work with computational graphics and visualizations is a foundational computer science skill. There are many applications for complex graphics and visualizations other than just gaming and creating 3D scenes. Potential applications include aerospace, healthcare, and finance visualizations. Being comfortable programming these projects is a great skill that I can add to my professional toolbelt.
